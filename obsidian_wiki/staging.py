"""Staged-write promotion — the mechanical half of `wiki-stage-commit`.

When ``WIKI_STAGED_WRITES=true``, skills write pages into ``_staging/`` instead of
the live vault, and a human approves them before they land. This module owns the
parts of that workflow that have one correct answer: what is queued, moving a
file to its live path, moving a rejection back to ``_raw/``, and refusing to do
either when the files changed since they were reviewed.

Judgment stays with the skill — whether a page *should* land, how to summarise
it, and how to merge a ``.patch.md`` whose surrounding text has moved on.
Promotion never rewrites a page: it is a rename, so frontmatter, body and links
arrive exactly as they were reviewed.
