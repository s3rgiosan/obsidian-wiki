"""Content-hash cache for wiki-ingest source tracking.

Provides a reliable, platform-independent alternative to running `sha256sum`
in the skill. The agent calls `obsidian-wiki cache-check` / `cache-update`
instead of shelling out to sha256sum and manually parsing .manifest.json.

Manifest format (.manifest.json in the vault root). Two `sources` shapes are
supported, because real vaults contain both:

1. Dict keyed by path (this module's original format)::

    {"sources": {"<abs-or-rel-path>": {"content_hash": "...", ...}}}

2. List of entry objects, each carrying its own ``path`` (the shape the
   wiki-ingest skill writes)::

    {"sources": [{"path": "_raw/foo.md", "content_hash": "sha256:...", ...}]}

Both shapes are read transparently, and `update_source` edits the manifest
*in place* — preserving its shape, any duplicate-path entries, and
skill-written fields (``pages_created``, ``size_bytes``, ``source_type``, …).

Hashes are compared prefix-insensitively: the skill records
``"sha256:<hex>"`` while this module computes a bare ``<hex>``, so an optional
``algo:`` prefix is stripped from both sides before comparison.
