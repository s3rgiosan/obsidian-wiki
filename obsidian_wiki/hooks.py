"""Install, remove, and inspect the Claude Code session hooks.

Two hooks bracket a session: ``wiki-session-recap.sh`` at SessionStart injects
the vault's memory, ``wiki-stop-capture.sh`` at Stop nudges a capture. They
only take effect once registered in ``~/.claude/settings.json``.

Until now that registration was a prose procedure in ``wiki-setup`` — locate
the script, hand-merge JSON, don't clobber other hooks — and only the Stop hook
had one. So a normal pip install got the storage and the CLI but never the
session-start injection, which is the headline feature. This is that procedure
as code, for both hooks, idempotent, and checkable by ``doctor``.
